### A Schematic Map of Lalbagh
Scale : Lalbagh, a 240 acre park, located in Bangalore (~800sq.km)
Audience : Walkers who visit Lalbagh
Purpose : A quick reference to walkways and utilities (Drinking Water, Food, Toilets, Parking) for walkers visiting Lalbagh. Major landmarks in the area to serve as visual references.

##### Reoriented 
The trace has been rotated clockwise so that the gates (North,South,East,West) are appropriately represented

##### Abstraction: Grids & geometric shapes :
An Isometric Grid has been used to represent all walkways as paths that intersect at 90 / 45 degrees only. Less relevant details in the path have been minimised. It has been represented as nodes, edges and paths around landmarks.

##### Explanation
* ###### Simplification Vs Minimal
	- Visual Clutter has been greatly reduced by keeping only the paths of interest and significant landmarks within the park
	- Several gardens exist within the park (Topiary,Rose,Cactus,Japanese...). These have not been represented to avoid clutter.
	- Curved and irregular paths have been straightened in the schematic representation
	- Roads around the park have not been represented. The gates in the 4 cardinal directions serve as entry points to the park.
* ###### Elements of Lalbagh
	- The park has four gates to enter from (North,South,East,West), that are geographically aligned. This has been preserved in the schematic representation.
	- An ancient monolithic rock formation (visible from the east gate) is represented in the map - "Peninsular Gneiss".
	- A large lake occupies a significant area within the park. This has an artificial waterfall and dams for water management and a bridge crossing over it. There are quite a few smaller lakes (non-perennial) that serve to accommodate spillovers from the main lake. The main lake has been represented in the final schematic. 
	- The walk ways are mostly tarred/paved except the walkway around the lake which is a compacted clay walkway.
	- The park has sufficient R.O. drinking water dispensers, car parking, small food carts and toilets distributed across the park. These have been represented as icons in the final schematic. 
* ###### Visual hierarchy
	- Entry points to the park 
	- Large landmarks (Lake, Rock formation)
	- Other landmarks (Glasshouse,Tower,Garden Clock, Horticultural HQ)
	- Utilities (Drinking Water, Food Carts/ vendors, Parking, Toilets)
	- Walkways
