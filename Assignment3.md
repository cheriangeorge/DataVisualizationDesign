### Design decisions
A conscious design decision was made to represent more effective antibiotics with smaller drops as this is closest to reality. Initial explorations with quite a few number transformations to  visually encode 'larger is better' were unsatisfactory. This visualisation does not represent precise concentrations (hard to show the difference between 0.005 and 0.001) and the exact numerical values have been deliberately avoided in the visualisation.  
### Visual Encoding, Colour and Scale
The light-blue circle represents a petri-dish with the bacteria (10,00,000 units of area) and the dark-blue drop represents the antibiotic. The size of the drop represents the minimum concentration of antibiotic required to prevent bacterial growth in vitro. The largest drop represents 8,70,000 units of area and the smallest drop represents 1 unit of area.

The smaller the drop size the more effective the antibiotic is against that specific bacteria.  The legend provided shows the concentration corresponding to each drop size.

The reaction of bacteria to covariate gram staining has been represented by pink (negative) and violet (positive) circles. The positive staining bacteria and negative staining bacteria have been bunched separately.
