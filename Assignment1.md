### Visualizing the Scale of Global Fossil Fuel Production ¹

![global-fossil-fuel-production-infographic_scaled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3922260/216781415-8ee72115-51bd-4911-ae9c-5839df6d6420.jpg)

- The juxtaposition of the the large cubes representing fossil fuel volumes and one of the world's tallest buildings  serves to shock and awe the general population, abstracting away the calculations to make an effortless visual comparison.
-  Comparing the height of the Burj Khalifa with the height of a cube representing a given volume of fossil fuel is extremely misleading as the scale of reference is totally different. Hence a _fallacy of inconsistency_ has been committed in the infographic - False equivalence - Colloquially "comparing apples and oranges."  This fallacy might have been mitigated by having bigger Burj Khalifas instead of the cubes - This would have preserved the volume-height relationship in the comparison.
- The original data was aggregated in terms of weight (eg: 8 billion tonnes of coal in 2021). In order to translate weight into something visually perceptible, the authors multiplied average densities for coal and oil and the compressed volume of liquefied natural gas. This volume was used create the cubes in the infographic. However the volume of the Burj Khalifa has not been considered in this comparison. 
- Now, it would be grossly inaccurate and misleading to _visually compare_ the weight of coal, oil or natural gas and the weight of the Burj Khalifa (The weight of the empty building is [500,000 tonnes](https://www.burjkhalifa.ae/img/FACT-SHEET.pdf).) So trying to quantify and compare these three natural resources using an alternate frame of reference might help a viewer visualise and perceive the vastness of these quantities², since it is _quite hard to comprehend and grasp large quantities_ in general. 
- The presentation of the graphic in 2-point perspective also creates a mild _Ponzo illusion_ - the human mind judges an object's size based on its background.
- While the quantities of crude oil, liquefied natural gas and coal have been _aggregated geographically and chronologically_ to represent the total quantities in the whole world during the whole of 2021, the quantity represented by the Burj Khalifa in the infographic is not derived from a similar aggregation. So this would be like comparing the total volume of wood of all the trees in the world grown during the whole of 2021, with the volume of the Burj Khalifa.
